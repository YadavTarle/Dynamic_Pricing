## Overview
Dynamic_Pricing is a project aimed at implementing dynamic pricing strategies to optimize revenue and customer satisfaction. This project involves data analysis, machine learning, and real-time pricing adjustments.

A ride-sharing company wants to implement a dynamic pricing strategy to optimize fares based on real-time market conditions. The company only uses ride duration to decide ride fares currently. The company aims to leverage data-driven techniques to analyze historical data and develop a predictive model that can dynamically adjust prices in response to changing factors.

The dataset containing historical ride data has been provided. It includes features such as the number of riders, number of drivers, location category, customer loyalty status, number of past rides, average ratings, time of booking, vehicle type, expected ride duration, and historical cost of the rides.

## Features
- Real-time price adjustments based on market demand
- Machine learning models to predict optimal prices
- Data analysis tools to monitor pricing performance
